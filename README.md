## Supabase Setup Guide

1. Create a Supabase account at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and log in.
2. Create a new Supabase project with a name and database password.
3. Enable authentication in the Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to **Authentication** and enable email/password or OAuth providers.
4. Create a storage bucket:
   - Go to **Storage** and create a bucket (e.g., `user-files`).
   - Set bucket privacy as needed.
5. Set bucket access policies:
   - Go to the **Policies** tab under your storage bucket.
   - Use the **Other policies under storage.objects** option to add policies.
   - Example policy to allow authenticated users to upload files:

     ```
   - Add policies to allow users to read/download and delete their own files based on metadata or naming conventions.
